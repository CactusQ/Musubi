text = "Help Leilani maximize her profit. Before each day you can purchase ingredients required to make musubi.

Each musubi will be covered with Saran wrap and have one savory slice of salty spam stacked on top of two fluffy scoops of Diamond G rice and tightly wrapped with a sticky but satisfying piece of roasted nori. 
In other words, making 1 musubi will always cost 1 of each shop item.

Leilani’s aunty also gifted her with some funky but festive flavors of furikake seasoning (wacky wasabi, kooky kimchi and swanky salmon) that she’s passing on to you to include some FREE additional tastiness to the musubi for your customers!
Each day you can choose one seasoning which will set the price for that day.
Higher prices have a lower probability to sell.

You can also buy posters for $20 before each day. This will lead to more foot traffic and thus more chances to sell musubi.
Foot traffic may also be influenced by daily events.
Game days and school assemblies will increase the amount of potential customers, while field trips and test days will keep the hallways more empty.

Leftover rice expire after each day. Ending the day prematurely will not affect sales."
